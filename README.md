# Jight-Sight

This is a **Formal Language and Compilers** course project.
The entire grammar of JavaScript language has been translated into Flex and Yacc (C language) from [ECMA International](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/).
With the web GUI one can write in JavaScipt language and get notified whenever a wrong syntax is used. Moreover, reserved words, identifiers and special characters are highlighted at compile time.


## How to use
- `git clone https://github.com/mryraghi/jigh-sight`
- `cd jigh-sight`
- `npm install`
- `meteor run`
- connect to `localhost:3000`
- write code in JavaScript and be amazed
